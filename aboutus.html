    <!-- Concept Section -->
    <h3 class="subtitle">Concept Behind the Name</h3>
    <div class="concept-box">
      <p>
        The name <strong>One 8 Gravity</strong> draws inspiration from our solar system:
        <br><strong>One star â€“ The Sun, 8 Planets, bound together by Gravity.</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        The sum of 1 + 8 = 9, the largest digit in the decimal system, representing our maximum efforts. Gravity symbolizes the attraction of positive energy.
      </p>
      <p>
        Interestingly, Earthâ€™s gravitational value is <strong>9.81</strong>, completing the name <strong>One 8 Gravity</strong> with serendipity.
